I am an independent software developer. I am creator of [geniuswiki](http://www.geniuswiki.com), an open source web-based WIKI software. You may know markup writing is the fundamental concept of WIKI. I made geniuswiki since 2007. So I am a crazy markup(not only Markdown) enthusiast. I am living in Sydney over 10 years but I definitely spend too much time on computer language rather than English. So, please correct and pardon me if you found any weird description here:)
